# RFPowerMeter
RF power meter and supply voltage meter for battery powered transmitter.

With this device you can measure RF power in watts and supply voltage in volts. Allowed supply voltage range is 7-14V, allowed transmitting power is 0-1000W and allowed frequency range is 10MHz-1GHz.

Easy to use. The device has only one button with three functions. By pressing once device wakes from sleep mode and show measured power in watts. By pressing again device switches to dBm mode and show power in dBm. Pressing third time device show measured supply voltage.

Device will shutdown automatically after 5 minutes. Current consumption is very minimal and does not affect significally to supply battery level. This is accomplished by using CMOS logics and LCD 7-segment display. Also Arduino sleep mode is used with conjunction of power measurement circuit chip enable signal control.

Physical size of device is with casing 13*13cm. PCB is 10*10cm. Dimensions excludes connectors and push button.
